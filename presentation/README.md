This presentation will begin with a brief history of educational programming languages. Afterward, we will give in-depth explanations of two modern educational programming languages: Scratch, a block-based, visual language designed to teach children basic programming principles, and Alice, an object-oriented drag-and-drop programming environment, designed to transition beginners into writing code in Java through creating interactive computer animations. Then, we will analyze both languagesâ€™ impact in the classroom, and the computer science field as a whole, as well as how they are taught. Finally, our talk will conclude with a comparison between Scratch, Alice, and other related languages currently in use in education.
